/**
 * Wrapper class for memory range [pair.first, pair.second). It provides
 * methods to fill specified range with unformatted content. There are also
 * free functions (operator<<) to fill range with formatted content.
 *
 * During instance creation, memory range is specified: first is write pointer
 * where additional content is written and second is upper limit pointer.
 * While filling content, write pointer is moved towards upper limit (i.e. no
 * original beginning is remembered). When write pointer reaches upper limit,
 * no more content will be actually copied but pointer is still moved forward.
 * In such situation, object state becomes bad() and size() method return
 * value is undefined.
