/**
 * Intrusive queue (FIFO) with possible concurrent usage.
 *
 * Queue elements of type \a T must provide \a Hook that stores opaque data
 * managed by owning queue. Any given time specific hook can be used only to
 * store element in single queue. Same hook can be used to store element in
 * different queues at different times. If application needs to store element
 * in multiple queues same time, it needs to provide multiple hooks, one per
 * holding queue.
 *
 * Being intrusive, queue itself does not deal with node allocation. It is
 * application's responsibility to handle node management and make sure that
 * while in queue, element is kept alive and it's hook is not interfered with.
 * Also, pushing and popping elements into/from queue does not copy them, just
 * hooks/unhooks using specified member \a Hook in \a T.
 *
 * Usage:
 * \code
 * class foo
 * {
 *   sal::mpsc_sync_t::intrusive_queue_hook_t hook;
 *   int a;
 *   char b;
 * };
 *
 * sal::queue_t<foo, sal::mpsc_sync_t, &foo::hook> queue;
 *
 * foo f;
 * queue.push(&f);
 *
 * auto fp = queue.try_pop(); // fp == &f
 * \endcode
