/**
 * Wrapper class for \c char[] array to gather formatted inserted values.
 *
 * Internally it holds \c char[] with \a Size plus one byte for NUL-terminator.
 * There is also pointer to end() of current content. It is updated every time
 * new content is added. Once application is done with current content, array
 * can be reset(), so new values can be inserted again. Internal buffer has no
 * NUL-terminator until c_str() is called.
 *
 * When array overflows, pointer to end() still keeps increasing if more
 * content is inserted but no actual data is added. Existing content is still
 * valid but not iterator returned by end(). Even if end() points past
 * internal array, distance between [begin(), end()) shows how many characters
 * would have been added with operator<<() if there would been enough room.
 *
 * This class is similar to C++17 std::string_view except it owns array and
 * allows to insert content there. Same time it is missing most of
 * std::string_view find/comparison/etc functionality. Once it is standardized
 * and included by g++/clang++/msvc, new getter will be added that returns
 * non-mutable std::string_view with internal array.
